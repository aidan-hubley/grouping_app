# [Inuaai Grouping Script](https://inuaai.com)
## What does it do?
This application is used to "group" a folder of images together
<br>"grouping" images together simply means to extend their filename to include a group identification number

_Example:_

| Before Grouping | After Grouping |
|-----------------|----------------|
| image0          | 1-image0       |
| image1          | 1-image1       |
| image2          | 2-image2       |
| image3          | 2-image3       |
| image4          | 3-image4       |
| image5          | 4-image5     |

This should allow for easy identification of grouping when editing images
