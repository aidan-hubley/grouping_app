# [Inuaai Grouping Script](https://inuaai.com)
## What does it do?
This application is used to "group" a folder of images together
<br>"grouping" images together simply means to extend their filename to include a group identification number

_Example:_

| Before Grouping | After Grouping |
|-----------------|----------------|
| image0          | image0-1       |
| image1          | image1-1       |
| image2          | image2-2       |
| image3          | image3-2       |
| image4          | image4-3       |
| image5          | image5-4       |

This should allow for easy identification of grouping when editing images
